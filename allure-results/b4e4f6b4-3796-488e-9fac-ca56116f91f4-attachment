# Error details

```
Error: Playwright Test did not expect test() to be called here.
Most common reasons include:
- You are calling test() in a configuration file.
- You are calling test() in a file that is imported by the configuration file.
- You have two different versions of @playwright/test. This usually happens
  when one of the dependencies in your package.json depends on @playwright/test.
